# What Are Hackathons?

At hackathons, people work together to fix problems and make cool things. These events are about teamwork and being creative. Hackathon Project Ideas help you find new ways to use computers and make things that help people.

These ideas can make you want to build something great and show what you can do. With Hackathon Project Ideas, you and your friends can think of good answers and learn a lot. It's a good way to test yourself and do something important.

Hackathons are time-bound events where people come together to build something new in a limited time. You work in teams, choose a problem, and try to create a working solution. Most hackathons last one or two days, so the focus is on learning fast and building quickly. In short, everyone shares ideas, codes together, and helps each other! You don’t need to know everything already. The goal is to try, learn, and create something useful by the end.
